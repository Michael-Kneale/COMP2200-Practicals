This repository contains practical notebooks for my work in COMP2200 (Data Science) at Macquarie University, in which I put into practice the many concepts and techniques I learnt throughout the unit.

These concepts/techniques include:

-Correlation/causation

-Predictive modelling

-Decision tree models

-Artifical neural networks
